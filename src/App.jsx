				Reflection (5â€“7 sentences):
				- The easiest component was the List because its API is straightforward.
				- The hardest was the DataGrid due to configuring sorting and pagination.
				- Cards present concise overviews and clear actions, improving scannability.
				- Badges provide quick notification context without navigating away.
				- Avatars aid recognition and reduce cognitive load in user lists.
				- Accordions help keep content dense yet accessible, reducing page clutter.
				- Together, these patterns enhance usability and help users act faster.
