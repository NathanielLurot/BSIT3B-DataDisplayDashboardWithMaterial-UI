# Data Display Dashboard with Material-UI

This project demonstrates common data display components using Material-UI in a React + Vite (SWC) setup.

## Reflection (5–7 sentences)
The easiest component to use was the List with Avatars because its API is straightforward and maps directly to common data arrays. The hardest was the DataGrid, mainly due to configuring sorting defaults and pagination while keeping the props concise. Cards help present concise overviews and clear actions, improving scannability for users who want quick context. Badges surface notification counts without navigating away, reducing friction and helping users prioritize. Avatars aid recognition in user lists and conversations, cutting down on cognitive load. Accordions keep dense content tidy and discoverable, enabling progressive disclosure without overwhelming the page. Together, these patterns improve usability and help users find and act on information faster in real-world apps.
